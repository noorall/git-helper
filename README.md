# GitHelper - AI Generated IntelliJ Plugin

**An IntelliJ IDEA plugin fully generated by AI for automatic code formatting on Git commits**

## 🎉 Grand Introduction

> **Note: This is a plugin completely generated by AI!** All code of this plugin was automatically generated by an AI assistant based on requirements, without any manual coding. The plugin implements complete functionality, including Git hook management, code formatting, asynchronous processing, and other advanced features.

## 📝 Project Introduction

GitHelper is a powerful IntelliJ IDEA plugin designed to enhance your Git workflow by automatically running code formatting tools during commits. It primarily integrates with the Spotless Maven plugin to automatically format Java files before committing, ensuring code style consistency.

### Core Features

- **Smart Code Formatting**: Automatically runs the Spotless Maven plugin to format changed Java files before Git commits
- **Dual Mode Support**:
  - Git Pre-commit Hook Mode (Recommended): Uses asynchronous communication without blocking the IDE interface
  - IntelliJ Commit Handler Mode: Synchronous execution, traditional approach
- **Progress Display**: Shows progress indicators during the formatting process
- **Configurable Settings**: Enable/disable features and customize Maven executable path
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with Git commit workflow
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any Git client when using Git hook mode

## 🚀 Installation and Usage

### Installation

> **Note: This plugin is currently in the testing phase and is not yet available on the IntelliJ IDEA Plugin Marketplace.**

1. Download the plugin ZIP file from the [Releases](https://github.com/leya521/git-helper/releases) page
2. In IntelliJ IDEA, go to `Settings/Preferences` → `Plugins` → `⚙️` (gear icon) → `Install Plugin from Disk...`
3. Select the downloaded ZIP file
4. Restart the IDE to activate the plugin

### Configuration and Usage

1. **Open Settings**:
   - Go to `Settings/Preferences` → `Tools` → `GitHelper`
   
2. **Choose Integration Method**:
   - **Git Pre-commit Hook Mode (Recommended)**: Uses asynchronous communication without blocking the IDE interface
   - **IntelliJ Commit Handler Mode**: Synchronous execution, traditional approach

3. **Configure Git Hooks**:
   - Enable "Auto-install hooks for new projects" in settings
   - Or manually configure using the `Tools` → `Configure Git Hooks` menu
   - The plugin will automatically install pre-commit hooks in Git repositories

4. **Enable Spotless Formatting**:
   - Ensure "Enable Spotless formatting on commit" option is checked
   - Customize Maven executable path as needed

### How It Works

#### Git Pre-commit Hook Mode (Recommended)
- The plugin intercepts commit operations in IDEA and starts background formatting tasks
- Git hook scripts listen to status files and wait for formatting completion
- After formatting completes, files are automatically re-staged and the commit process continues

#### IntelliJ Commit Handler Mode
- Executes Spotless formatting directly in IDEA synchronously during commits
- Shows progress dialog with cancel option
- Continues normal commit process after formatting completes
